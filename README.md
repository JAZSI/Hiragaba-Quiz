# Hiragana Quiz

This is a simple web application that helps users practice their knowledge of the Hiragana writing system in Japanese. The app displays a random Hiragana character and prompts the user to type the corresponding Romanji (the phonetic equivalent in the Latin alphabet) into an input field.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Type the Romanji equivalent of the displayed Hiragana character in the input field and press enter.
4. If you entered the correct answer, a new random Hiragana character will be displayed, and your streak will increase by one.
5. If you entered an incorrect answer, an error message will be displayed, and your streak will reset to zero. Try again!
